DOM EVENTS WITH JAVASCRIPT



you completed the lesson! Now you’ve learned about JavaScript events and you can leverage these events on the DOM to create interactivity with event handlers.

Let’s review what you’ve learned:

* JavaScript engines register events as objects with properties and methods associated with them.
* Event handlers are registered as properties of their event object.
* Event object properties like .target, .type, and .timeStamp are used to provide information about the event.
* The .addEventListener() method can be used to add multiple event handler functions to a single event.
* The .removeEventListener() method stops specific event handlers from “listening” for specific events firing.
